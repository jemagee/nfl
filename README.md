# README

This application is an early stages project for downloading game data from NFL.com, processing it into a SQL based datbase and presenting the data in new, and hopefully interesting, ways.

### Getting Started

	1.  Fork and Clone the repository
	2.  run Bundler to bring gems current
	3.  This project uses Postgres in development and testing, as such you need to create a nfl_test and nfl_development database in your postgres
	4.  Rspec spec/ to make sure all tests pass properly
	5.  Seed file contains foundational information for the Game and Team Models.  It is used in the testing process so it should be left alone.


### Contributions

Contributions, suggestions are welcome and even encouraged.  Please submit pull requests on separate branches.  Please keep your repository current by setting up an upstream to fetch from.  This project is still in very active development so might be updated multiple times a week.  Please write tests that pass for any contributions even if they are UI/UX contributions.
